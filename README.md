# scBALF Covid-19 dataset Analysis

Here is the Github page that has the codes for the bioinformatics pipeline described in the paper **COVID-Datathon: Biomarker identification for
COVID-19 severity based on BALF scRNA-seq data**. 


## Biomarker Identification By Monocle:

The **scBALF_Monocle.md** file from the Monocle folder explains how one can extract the list of potential COVID-19 severity biomarkers using Monocle. The R markdown files are also available in the same folder.

## BALF Cells Classification:

In the second step of our proposed pipeline we run multiple linear and non-linear machine learning classification algorithms to perform cell classification ( One lable vs the rest). Here we explain how one can run these classification algorithms:

1. **Lindear Discriminant Aanlysis (LDA):**

The **LDA.md** file from the LDA folder explains how one can run perform cell classification using LDA. The R code files are also available in the same folder.

2. **Quadratic Discriminant Aanlysis (QDA):**

The **QDA.md** file from the QDA folder explains how one can run perform cell classification using QDA. The R code files are also available in the same folder.

3. **Fleaxible Discriminant Aanlysis (FDA):**

The **FDA.md** file from the FDA folder explains how one can run perform cell classification using FDA. The R code files are also available in the same folder.

4. **Support Vector Machine (SVM) with RBF kernerl**

The **SVM.md** file from the SVM folder explains how one can run perform cell classification using SVM. The R code files are also available in the same folder.

5. **Random Forest (RF)**

The **RF.md** file from the RF folder explains how one can run perform cell classification using RF. The R code files are also available in the same folder.
